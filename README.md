# AnimeCalendar.github.io

AnimeCalendar.github.io is a website to help you keep track of your seasonal anime across multiple
streaming services. You can create your own list of anime and AnimeCalendar.github.io will track
and display your watch history for the current week and last week. Mess around with
AnimeCalendar.github.io settings to personalize the calendar.

All user data is stored locally, meaning data cannot be shared with multiple devices. This allows
AnimeCalendar.github.io to stay 100% free and NO ADS!!! While not have any overhead costs. I
recommend only using your personal device. Your data is transferable, you can move your data
between devices if you have the technical skills. Look up JavaScript localStorage if you think you
can handle it.

Three options will appear. This options will determine how the anime information will display.

## Top View

## Side View

## Window View

## My Streams Setting

When you select an anime, you may notices the numbers next to each stream. If you press any of your
number keys you will open new tab based on corresponding stream. Pressing the number keys is fine
and fast but not all anime have the same stream so this order of streams might feel randomized.

To overcome this you instead just press the W key but must set your My Stream settings. To do this
you press all the check boxes which stream you like. You can even change the order of preference
by dragging each stream.

# Search Bar

Press the S key to quick access the search bar.

The search bar is not case sensitivity but spelling will affect your results. However you do not
need to completely type what you are looking for. For example, if your searching for Demon Slayer
you can type "demon" and hit enter and if there is no other anime with "demon" in its title then
Demon Slayer should pop. If there is an anime does have "demon" in its title then the anime who is
higher in the alphabetic queue will pop. For example, if the anime Demon King Daimao was in the
search result then Demon King Daimao will pop as it is higher in the alphabetic queue than
Demon Slayer. To avoid previous scenario you instead type "slay" and press enter and Demon Slayer
will pop.
